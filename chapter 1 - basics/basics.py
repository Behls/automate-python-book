# datatype conversions

# converting decimal to int - this can obviously be changed to a passed in variable.
decimal = int(1.2) # converts to int 1
converted = str(29) #converts to str '29'
another = float(1) # converted to float  1.0
print (type(decimal))
print(type(converted))
print(type(another))
print (another)

print(round(12.17583430,0))
